And hell bully babies in general for all those that are mixed or pure because ya all know as well as I do love is love. I hate the name pitbull because it was the name given by dog fighters. Ive found people respond better with the original names of the dogs. Its the stigma that the term pitbull brings that I think destroys these dogs true personalities.</td></tr><tr><td>꼬부기아빠 My Pet Diary</td><td>65053.0</td><td>꼬비야 정말 우주의 신비가 너의 눈에 있다 ...❤</td></tr><tr><td>꼬부기아빠 My Pet Diary</td><td>65053.0</td><td>ㅠㅠ너무 이쁘다 쵸꼬비...✨ 보다가 같이 나른해져서 잘 뻔 했습니다..</td></tr><tr><td>Robin Seplut</td><td>65106.0</td><td>It wants milk</td></tr><tr><td>Big Cat Rescue</td><td>65106.0</td><td>Such a weird meowLoved it tho</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>65651.0</td><td>Did yoy keep the puppy and take it home with youplz anser mr.DODO. may god bless you</td></tr><tr><td>RaleighLink14</td><td>65992.0</td><td>Since bratayley put up this video annie only went to see her horse 2 times.

Whats wrong is government and society to think that a particular land belongs to them n if animals want to live on that space they have to live according to our rules.

The four places in history that developed writing systems were due to having actual needs - agriculture for growing communities required more brain power than individuals could muster.  They needed to offload their past learning into written documents.  This way new people can learn what to do without bugging the few people already know effectively creating government ordinances.  Seeing the power of communicating across distances some people borrowed the governments writing system and tailored it for their own purposes.  The most effective motivator for learning to read and write has always been a government requiring someone to understand a writing system under punishment of losing money.I believe writing to be useful as an alternate rendering of ideas.  Yes ASL videos capture your meaning accurately for someone who knows ASL.  It has a lot of nuance that culturally literate people may notice.  But the closed captions are there to eliminate the nuances.  You use standard spelling and proper grammar so others can look up your meaning even if they are not culturally literate English speakers.If you had published your captions in a blog post people can actually read four times faster than your speech / signing.  I could skim the paragraphs of the blog post quickly looking for something that is relevant to me.  It can be indexed by Google or I can just use the Find feature in my browser for particular words.  It can be automatically (though poorly) translated into hundreds of other languages.  I can print it out and highlight parts of it for review later.  Dictionary writers encyclopedias magazines books newspapers etc. can use your blog post as source material.ASLWrite or Si5s could realize these kind benefits.  My personal take is that an alphabet is better than picture writing because it doubles as an index.  I created the ASLSJ writing system because I wanted to use ASL words in my computer programs.  It only uses the alphabets letters so I could upload the closed captions for your video in ASLSJ today.Your video starts with the ASL word hello.  In English each letter of a word phonetically tells you how to move your lips tongue and throat to pronounce the word.  In ASLSJ the word bepo-r phonetically tells you to put your open-B handshape (the first two letters - be) in front of your chin (the next letter - p) with the palm turned out (next letter - o) then move the hand to the right (-r).  bepo-r is an ASL idea.  It does not require translation into English and it does not require an artists painting like ASLWrite or Si5s.  Now I can create a dictionary to hold that word and thousands more.  Unfortunately it wouldnt help because nobody would want to read it - so were back to square one.</td></tr><tr><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>114368.0</td><td>so cute</td></tr><tr><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>114368.0</td><td>sorry for the turtle，he cant clean the bird poop on his own</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>114567.0</td><td>Omg!

Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry.

I was completely devastated and cried a lot. She never came to me in my dreams even though i asked her.  She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you so much for your videos. I was in my bed all day and not able to eat anything after my dog has passed and when I started to watching your videos I have got up and eat. I also purchased your book and got signs from him.

Ive always been non believer. I always felt guilty because Im convinced I didnt do enough for him and I scolded him sometimes for things that werent his fault. Soon after his death he started to visit me in my dreams. The first dream I had was horrible he looked fine and healthy but when I tried to pet him he turned skin and bones almost a skeleton. The following visits were better he stil looked old and dirty but he was always eating and he didnt look like he was suffering and I felt like he never died and he just returned from where I never realized in my dreams. Every time he visited me I always woke up crying and I went on crying for the whole following day I dont even know why.Its been a lot since the last time he visited me the last night I thought just that I havent seen my cat since a whole year now I would love if he could visit me again... and that night he visited me again stil looking sick but he was eating a lot and looking happy overall and it was like he never died. I knew in my dream that he was 26 years old and I kept saying we need to call the vet and get the surgery done this time or his condition will get worse... The vet will be very surprised on his improvements though he put on a lot of weight and he looks like a different cat from the last time the vet came... why did the vet came last time? He just looked at him and did nothing how weird (in reality the last time the vet came it was to put him down)... and that morning I wake up and started crying again and now I realized that my cat stopped visiting me because he didnt want to make me cry every time he showed up. Do you think its that the reason he didnt came more often? Thanks for your videos and your help.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I like the day to day stuff so I would watch if it isnt snake related.

I currently have three dogs six cats 1 snake and 1 rabbit.  How many pets is too many? When you get to the point where you can not take care of them properly. And I dont mean adequately giving them the basics: food water etc. I mean when you get to the point that your attention can not be divided any further.  Its also a matter of whats important to you.  Somebody who spends their time at work out with friends shopping etc. would say holy shit you have too many pets how do you do it? I can do it because I WANT to give my extra time to them. Between classes? I dont go to the mall I take my dogs to a park.  Its all about whats important to you.  I want to come home and pet my cats.  Curl up in bed with a pile of fluff.  People say how can you afford it? Again. Its all about where you choose to put your money.  I would much rather spend my extra money on good dog food cat toys things for my snakes terrarium than on expensive clothes or shoes or makeup.  Id rather save money for vet appointments than vacations.  Its just. I donno. Its that animal loving gene you were talking about. Some people get it or they dont.  As for do you have too many pets?  You have too many when you start forgetting their names and oh yeah! I have a bearded dragon over here. If you have the time and WANT to greet and spend time with each of your pets at the shop. Then youre more than entitled to have them Brian.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>my dog just past awey to.i now how it fiells .bless your dog i hope he makes it throow.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Im so sorry my puppys are my everything Im so sorry Ill pray for her aswell</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I can relate to you I have 9 dogs 7 of my dogs died so i have two dogs left🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I hope arty gets better so so sorry but I know what your feeling because my dog got cancer she been in the family for 9 years I am 9 so she was there at the same time I was born but she is still alive</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I have a dog too.

YOu are one lucky dude you didnt lose your leg by waiting a few days to seek treatment and getting the antibiotic treatment.  You of all people know dogs lick every thing and every where and the butt licking etc is where the worst germs are and when you get the bite and germs go in they can go in deep and fast and people become septic and lose limbs and life because they think its just a little dog bite and my dog is sweet.  It is all about the germs and how fast they can make you sick.  I am glad you are on your way to healing.  I hope you dont have to have an operation.

I have a male Yorkshire Terrier who is around nine years old. He is a rescue and is also neutered. He will sometimes go about the house sniff about and pee wherever he wants until there‘s no more pee coming out. To add in we also have a male Maltese at around the age of three who is not neutered and a female poodle mix at around the age of ten who is spayed. The Maltese also sometimes pees around the house but not as often as the Yorkie does. Also the males tend to get into these brawls with one another that can get quite vicious so we try our best to keep the male dogs separated. Also the Yorkie has somewhat of a runaway problem so we are pretty much on our toes almost all the time about him. Now whether or not some of that is jealousy territorial etc etc... I don‘t know.

Thanks Brad Jen and Lee!</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Nicole I WISH you were here @ our house when a giant Bull Mastiff showed-up here one morning - he was gigantic apparently lost but was obviously someones pet as his ears & tail had been cropped and he wore a chain collar. Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done eating the last of the cat kibbles I sat on a lawn chair and he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing. He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the back door of the K-9 unit he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing! We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.  He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Heres what I will say: thank you for producing a very well done short introductory film with two fine women who have devoted their lives to the betterment of this specific breed. There are likely to be thousands of ignorant and uninformed uneducated bias-ridden comments on any of your video threads particularly some of these rarer breeds that have been referred to as bastardized. These are coming from people who generally do not understand the real concept of what preservation breeding truly means and the devotion it takes to protect a breed and better it with each generation especially having come from a virtually extinct gene pool. People who rally around bashing anything on the Internet I find rely heavily on said resource to inform what they know about a breed (or various other topic). If you do not own train breed medically treat or fervently study any breed of dog you are not an expert on it. Relying on various social media platforms to properly and thoroughly educate individuals on all that was is and will be a Shar-Pei is an unfathomable notion. I celebrate this video and who stand behind it—this information is correct but it is also only a 25 minute long feature that highlights the most significant information for the average person. I encourage everyone that feels so inclined to say they know this breed and make claims that are unfounded to take a step back and ask themselves really how educated and unbiased they are because most of the comments I read are riddled with opinions that are not founded on experience or proper study. Go to a library go to a dog history museum go to the breed clubs historians read books; go to shows and ask the people who are handling the dogs youre interested in. This video channel is a fabulous resource and I applaud the effort put into all the videos but its just a starting point for each breed. The Chinese Shar-Pei standard can be found on the breed club website cspca.com and it fully serves as the proper educational and historical resource the breed bashers should really consider investigating. Its too bad the Internet social media and backyard breeders have painted such a negative view of my breed in so manys eyes. This is not what the purpose of preservation breeding is supposed to be: its about keeping the health and temperament at the forefront of the breeders minds in protecting the dogs and keeping their history alive. Calling them useless I personally found completely harsh and offensive especially considering that I take mine to obedience class every week do therapy programs and am training for agility with my female. They are highly intelligent and purposeful breeding preserves their all purpose farm dog capabilities and you are foolish if you choose to believe that they are weak soft stupid or unsound as a generalization of the breed. Well socialized and hand reared Shar-Pei puppies are non such a thing. They may be fixated on their one person but a sound dog is never overly timid fearful or aggressive. Assertive powerful smart and excessively loyal... they can do it all if you invite them to it and I cannot overstate how significant the natural guarding and protection ability inherently withdraws from my dogs when they feel I am being threatened or challenged. To my friends who poured a lot into this video thank you. To all else who choose to explore the breed more I encourage you to do so... without relying on only one source of information.

A family bought him as a 9month pup for a gift to their 5yearold with cancer. Unfortunately the little girl didnt live to meet him and for the mother it was too heartbreaking to keep him. So she was going to dump him in the nearest shelter.My family happened to be visiting the day she was going to dump him and we were able to take him in ourselves. In February he turned six and is a very happy healthy stubborn butt head haha.The second is a BorderCollie/Lab mix named Pepper. He was a stray that wandered in December during the worst freeze wed seen. He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy.

Ive also got a 3 stray cats in a alley way to trust me and rub all over me and stuff like that. I recently took care of a black half tailed kitten that was starving because the owners werent feeding her.......I know their neice and she said that the cat is just there to hang around and get pregnant. So I started feeding her and I named her Jamaica .....she was my best cat friend she would follow me everywhere and hang out with me.....then she got pregnant and THEN the owners started caring for her.....I miss her.

On shock she responds great on an 8 while training with no distractions.  If she gets distracted she doesnt really pay attention to shit on the shock side that I feel comfortable with.  That said vibration for some reason every since I started the conditioning with her she just stops everything and lays down.  I didnt train that or anything that has just always been her natural reaction so I just left that and when she gets distracted and I need her attention vibrate.  Anyway I had a question with how to help my dog stay calm with other people.  When someone comes over she just gets super excited and does this cry whimper noise.  She will eventually calm down but I would rather a barking alert when someone comes to the house not an overly excited whimpering dog wanting attention.  I dont want an overly aggressive dog either though.  Can you help me out?</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>THANK YOU Larry! Ive never had a dog that wasnt intact and I have also never had a pregnancy or let my dog impregnate someone elses dog. Ive had multiple intact male giant schanuzers together in the home.

Why I feed raw why my dog is intact why I refuse to over vaccinate why I use an ecollar.. the list goes on. Yet the same people ask me for advice! Why does your dogs coat look so shiny?

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

It drives me insane when people say you dont know what youre talking about. You know exactly what youre talking about. You understand dog behaviour/learning to the key. Youre learning about human psychology now. Yet all those concepts also apply to animals. The things you will accomplish... just keep your mind to it keep going and youll always succed! Youll always face adversity but thats normal thats part of it all its especially part of being successful; people will always wanna bring you down even if youre great.Omg that part where Chuck yells at his client LOOK AT HIM! HES LOOKING AT ME! HE HAS NO BUSINESS LOOKING AT ANYTHING! (Bla bla bla). WOW! What a crock of shit! Shitty trainers like that get dogs killed. This kind of training is EXACTLY what turned my own dog into a monster back in the days when I didnt know any better and I somehow thought this all made sense. I thought I had to correct the stare-down. I was even told I could correct my dog for having her hackles or tail up! I was TOLD that! Instead I could have been click/rewarding my dog for looking at triggers. But nope I was too busy choking or yanking my dog on a prong collar; she became extremely paranoid and pre-emptively aggressive any time a person or dog came in sight or she so much as *thought* another person or dog was present - it could be a garbage bag/can on the side of the road a tree/bush a shadow a sound of any sort that resembled footsteps or a collar/tags jingling. So many different things became potential triggers and my dog was basically psychotic from this sort of training/treatment.Shes still an anxious dog and I dont think that will change - I dont think my dog will ever be what she could have been - but at least now she can predict what is going to happen in most common situations. An unfamiliar dog appears - treats are delivered or we quickly go through some fun Rally-O moves or tricks - Front get ready heel sit get in or Spin wave beg take a bow - treat treat treat. Fun stuff happens. And she will never be on a choke or prong again - her reaction to being on a harness or gentle leader is so much different. Even on a flat collar she still gets uncomfortable because she feels that conditioned emotional response to pressure on her throat.Anyways Im so glad I found better ways. Glad you do what you do. Keep on! Sorry for my random long comment. Every now and then I like to explain my background with my dog a bit another thing that drives me crazy is when people dont think I know what theyre talking about when it comes to corrections and the training tools they use. No I get it... I just know better now.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>the little white dog started the shit and then the owner of the white dog came out with a bat. like fuck yeah my dog would protect me and the guy with the white dog is yelling at the pitpull guy about not keeping his dog on s leash when he did the same fucking thing. the pitbull guy was at least watchinh his dog maybe from a distance but at least his back wasnt turned. and the pitbull was just strolling.and the second pitt seemed like a younger dog that just wanted to play and was jumping to play. like just because its a pitt doesnt mean its automatically violent and trying to attack. the pitt did nothing after the dog was in the car just walkes around wagging his tail looking for it</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>sometimes i get into a fight with my cat with a hand and its strong as hell he can scratch and bite my hand to blood and if it gets seriously angry its hard to get it off my hand.

If one really has the best interests of the dog at heart he/she would stop with the gimmicks and put in the time and effort to train the dog properly for lasting results.

I was losing fish went from 15 to 4 in a very short amount of time and I was trying everything to save them. It turned out to be my tap water. I got it tested and it contained a chemical from algae that while not harmful to humans it is deadly to fish. I contacted my towns local water district but got no where. I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again. Just know you are not alone we all have things happen no matter how careful we are. I had been in the hobby 20 years before my catastrophe happened but it happened and watching your videos along with others helped me realize that sometimes things just happen in the hobby and you cant let it beat you.

Growing up I lived in an area with no stray cats at all and I never saw another cat in the neighborhood.  We did live on a kind of busy road but not too busy and my cat happily went inside and out for his whole life.  Generally he just wanted to go outside and sit in the sun.  When he was younger hed roam more and fight but he lived to be almost 25 so it didnt harm him.Where I live now Id NEVER let my cats outside!  There are stray cats everywhere which is a huge vector for disease there are tons of fleas and ticks which is also a vector for disease.  IMO the rule of thumb has to be it depends on the cat and it depends on where you live.  Some cats are street smart and some arent and imo a road with no traffic is probably more dangerous than a road with a lot of traffic where cats deal with cars all the time.  But its always safer to keep them inside.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I live in a rural area on a 5 acre property and my cats have always been free to do as they like indoors and outdoors.

His name was Jimmy. I had him for about 2 weeks? I had everything right. He was eating he was healthy. I had an outdoor pond for him with a working fountain and everything and I was cleaning the pond and had him in a separate kiddy pool. Well we went inside to eat and my dad THOUGHT he closed the gate. Well my dog got ahold of him.. after 2 hours of searching we found him in the backyard with a collapsed shell  :c  he was still alive and struggling to breathe. He was fairly attached to me and Im obsessed with turtles and was extremely attached to him. He nipped at everyone but me in the past couple of hours.. my dad put him out of his misery and I didnt see it. He placed my baby Jimmy in a box and we buried him in the backyard.

Also I dont understand why people say you kill your animals. Sometimes you get unlucky and life happens we all die one way or another. I recently had to put my cat down at the vet after sudden heart failure. One day to the next he couldnt breathe properly and a few hours later he was gone. A few months before he underwent two surgeries to remove a strange lump/cyst in his neck and I believe that might have cause a strain on his heart. He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer. Dont listen to the haters! P.S. I watch your channel since I could never keep pets like yours for myself. I find animals fascinating but I think Ill stick to my cats and hopefully a dog in the future.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>thx youve inspired me to buy fish of my own i have 3 gold fish and one cat fish theyer really playful oh and my sister has a betta my cat fish name is whiskerz 2 of my gold fish have white the one white face and fins name is hayvin the other one with white splats name us kambriee and my last gold fish name is goldie thx for helping me</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>I started to crying with you... this reminds of my dogs death.... her name was Nutella... she was a beautiful black and white springer spaniel... she was the sweetest girl and I loved her dearly... but on the last months of her life she couldnt walk anymore would pee and poo where she was lying and her pee was super thick like syrup... she had massive ear infections her ears smelt like rotted meat... and she wouldnt even eat or drink without our help... so we had to put her down.... it was one of the hardest days of my life...

There the vet said she was only feeling bad because of the climate and that she needed to be in a fresh place and so we did that... She didnt get better by night and I think I saw it coming cause I had a really long talk with her about our future. Around 4:00 am Sunday she died and that really tore me up. We were a full week not knowing what happened to her and by that time we were putting three puppies (of another couple of dogs) for adoption and one of them fell very sick when playing with a toy that used to be of Camila. We took them to another vet where we finally found out what had happened... It was Canine Parvovirus... We managed to save the three puppies and found them a home.

Your can you groom my dog? video brought me to your channel and you definitely changed my perspective on pet ownership for the better.

Im a beginner so i got a beta fish instead but i did everything i could to make sure its in a healthy and stable habitat and i made sure to inform my mother about every last detail about his PROPER care. Its been about 6 months and he is still alive and well! Thanks to you!

I freaked out confused how the heck the turtle came from and I still to this day dont know where it came from. I showed my parents and so we took it out and I checked what gender it was and it was a female and was a red eared slider (I live in Texas) I kept her a while my parents bought me a big aquarium with all the good things and i took good care of her. Yet she didnt grow I then realize the aquarium we got doesnt have a good heating lamp. I realized I could afford the actual good lamp to help her grow. Luckily my aunt and uncle are good animal keepers and said they would gladly take her. A couple weeks ago I gave her away to them and they showed me pictures and I almost teared up seeing her swimming and living a good life . If your wondering why I didnt put her back in the wild she was so small. Maybe even smaller then these turtles. Idk when she hatched but I couldnt just let a small baby turtle back in the wild and all the ponds near me have snakes and other turtles but I didnt want her to die because she was a sweet turtle. Sorry for such a long story about my turtle.

They insisted my dog needed flea protection and as a new dog owner I assumed the vet knew what was best. She gave my guy Sentinel and now he has occasional seizures which my vet wanted to charge me over $1000 just to look into (then likely give him worse medication). Vets are just like actual doctors. They get paid to suggest medications to you and walk away with a percentage each time they convince you to buy it. Its disgusting that no doctor ever talks about the side effects of any prescriptions they give. Im just glad my dog was only on Sentinel for a year taking one pill a month.

She had an eye infection and was a liter of a ferral(?) cat and they basically ate the food we put outside for them because we already had 2 cats of our own at the time. And one stood out. She kept running into walls and lost balance a lot. My sister was able to catch her and my mom already had dealt with a cat eye infection before so we were able to use anything from our last infection on the kitten. And basically that night I got instantly attached to her. She would come to me climb up on my shoulder and she would CONSTANTLY and STILL does today at 1 licks my face and my ear. We fed her kitten food and she slept in my room in a little dog crate we had temporary for a rabbit. She was so quick at using the restroom and she slept through the entire night. We instantly became inseparable. I would come home from school to a screaming kitten and wanting to play when I run through the door and excited to play with her.  She not only became attached to me but to my dog. She now grooms him sleeps next to him sleeps on his her and always follows him around. We eventually caught her two other sisters one we gave to our neighbor/my moms best friend and the other one we kept. We were gonna give her away because she would always hide under the couch and was just so cereal. It took us 3 months for her to finally come around and now her and my mom love each other. They are such a blessing in my life and seeing Nemo grow up reminds me so much of them when they were kittens. Also Taylor  you dont need to be sorry for not uploading its fine! We love you!

Analysis and Future work\n\nIn this project, the dataset of user comments for youtube videos related to animals or pets with 5820035 observations is used to identify cat or dog owners by using mainly pyspark ml package deployed on Databricks.\n\nIn the data processiong part, the observations with null comments were dropped and the new dataset ended up with 5818984 observations. Then based on the comments, some key words like \"my cat\", \"my dog\" and \"my puppy\" was created to first label the observaitons with dog/cat owners as label 1 and non dog/cat owners as lebel 0. After labeling the dataset, the train set and test set were generated for the model fitting part. Notice that data is very unbalanced in terms of the labeling, so in order to have a more balanced data, I first splitted the data with only label 1 and label 0  to get approximately equal labelling and then combined them to do the future split for train set and test set. So, the data that I ended up being used has the following information in terms of the labelling and observation number:\n\nDataset Count: 56905\nTraining Dataset Count: 39958\nTest Dataset Count: 16947\nTraining Dataset with Label 1 Count: 19910\nTraining Dataset with Label 0 Count: 20048\nTest Dataset with Label 1 Count: 8378\nTest Dataset with Label 1 Count: 8569\n\nWith the sample data ready, I did tokenization and vectorization on the data and then I tried logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting tree these three models to classify the pet owners. For each of the models, I performed a 5-fold cross validations and using metric AUC to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. The result is shown below:\n\n               Gradient Boost  Logistic Regression  Random Forest\n    Index                                                        \n    Before CV          0.9383               0.9463         0.9252\n    After CV           0.9525               0.9515         0.9253\n\nSo based on the dataframe above, before cross validataion, logistic regression has the best performance in predicting the pet owner. But after cross validation, gradient boost tree has the best AUC and the prediction performance increases 1.5%. In general, I think these three models all did good job in prediction since the maximum of AUC is 1 and the AUC for these three models are pretty close to 1 even before the cross validation. \n\nThe best hyperparameter for the gradient boost tree is maximum depth = 6, maximum bins = 20, maximum iteration = 20 and with other parameters set to default. \n\nAfter having the best model, I built a new pipeline that also includes the best model to fit the whole data that I used to do the model training and then transformed it on the rest of the unseen data which has 5762079 observations.\n\nThe number of predicted Dog/Cat Owner is 564468, which is 22% of the total user. Compared with using only the key word to classify pet owner, the percentage is only 0.4% of the total user.\n\nIn terms of the comments of pet/dog owners, by reading some of their comments, I found that most of the video they are watching are just entertaining and most of the audience expressed their feelings towards the video. So a sentimental analysis based on the comments can further be done (having hard time working this on spark since it is pretty slow…. But still trying…. ). \n\nIn terms of the youtuber, the percentage of creators with cat and dog owners in the audience is 74.26% and Brave Wilderness, Brian Barczyk, The Dodo and Taylor Nicole Dean are the creators with top 4 number of pet owners audience and meanwhile, these 4 youtubers has a relatively high number of subscribers (over 1M). Since they have a very large amount of audience, so the chance of having the pet owners will be also higher compared to those youtubers with less audience. Thus, it is not surprising that the percentage of pet owners for these youtubers is around 20%~30%. I then restricted the total number of comment audience to be over 1000 (considered as actively youtubers). StormyRabbits, wingsNpaws, Menthol, Kratom, RaleighLink14 and Think Like A Horse has approximately 50% of their audience as pet owners.\n\nBased on the analysis above, some recommendations can be made. \n1. Youtube Video Recommendation (You may like section): after performing the sentimental analysis on the comments, Youtube can know the preference of the audience in more detail since it’s describing in words.)So based on this information, the video recommendation can be more precise along with the play history for that user. \n2. Ads Recommendation: Classifying the audience with different labels can help Youtube better promote the ads. For example, in this case, if the audience is predicted as pet owner, then the audience can be more likely to click a pet suppliance related ads especially for those youtubers whose majority audience are pet owners. And the ads can even appear on the google search page or gmail page to increase the click rate."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"Youtube data analysis","notebookId":3379718548094259},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
